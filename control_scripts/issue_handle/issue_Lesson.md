# Issue Resolution

**Issue Summary**: TypeScript type mismatch errors with null values and missing module import
**Root Cause**: 
1. Database schema allows null values for `difficulty` and `reviewCount` fields
2. Component interfaces expected non-null numbers
3. TypeScript strict null checking caused compatibility issues
4. Import path resolution issue with relative imports in Next.js

**Resolution Steps**: 
1. Fixed import path by changing from relative import `'./StudyPageClient'` to absolute import `'@/app/decks/[deckId]/study/StudyPageClient'`
2. Updated data transformation in study page to use nullish coalescing operator (`??`) instead of logical OR (`||`) for better type safety
3. Added data transformation in deck detail page to ensure non-null values for `difficulty` and `reviewCount`
4. Used consistent null handling pattern across both pages

**Key Learnings**: 
- TypeScript strict null checking requires explicit handling of null values
- Nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is more precise than logical OR (`||`) for null handling
- Absolute imports are more reliable than relative imports in Next.js dynamic routes
- Data transformation should happen at the boundary between database queries and component props
- Consistent null handling patterns prevent similar issues across the application

**Prevention Tips**: 
- Always define clear interfaces for component props with explicit null handling
- Use nullish coalescing operator (`??`) for default values instead of logical OR (`||`)
- Prefer absolute imports over relative imports in dynamic routes
- Transform data at the API boundary to match component expectations
- Use TypeScript strict null checking to catch these issues early
