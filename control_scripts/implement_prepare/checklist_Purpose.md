# Complex Module Implementation System

## Purpose
This file contains the implementation plan for complex modules that require multiple implementation steps. Each time a new complex module is identified, this file will be completely replaced with the new module's implementation plan.

## Current Status
No complex module is currently being planned. This file is ready to receive implementation plans for complex modules.

## Implementation Workflow
1. Analyze module complexity
2. Create detailed step-by-step plan
3. Document plan in this file (replacing old content)
4. Wait for user approval
5. Execute implementation with progress tracking

## File Usage
- **Purpose**: Store implementation plans for complex modules
- **Update Rule**: Always replace entire content for new modules
- **Format**: Markdown with clear step-by-step instructions
- **Content**: Module purpose, implementation steps, dependencies, expected outcomes
