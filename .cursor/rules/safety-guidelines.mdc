  - Deleting files or directories
  - Removing code blocks, functions, or components
  - Clearing file contents
  - Removing dependencies or imports
  - Uninstalling packages or libraries

## Command Execution Policy
- **ALWAYS ask for permission before running any commands** that could affect the system or project
- This includes but is not limited to:
  - Package installation/removal commands (npm, yarn, pip, etc.)
  - Database operations
  - Build or deployment commands
  - File system operations
  - Environment setup commands
  - Git operations that modify the repository

## Exception Cases
- Reading files and directories for analysis is always allowed
- Searching through code is always allowed
- Providing code suggestions and explanations is always allowed

## Communication
When asking for permission, clearly explain:
1. What action you want to take
2. Why it's necessary
3. What the potential impact might be
4. Any alternatives if available
